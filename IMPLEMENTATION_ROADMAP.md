## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Standards
```dart
// File naming convention
// Features: feature_name_screen.dart, feature_name_provider.dart
// Services: service_name_service.dart
// Models: model_name.dart
// Utils: utility_purpose.dart

// Code organization
// Each feature should be self-contained with models, providers, screens, services
// Shared utilities should be in core/ or shared/
// Configuration should be in config/
```

### Database Migration Strategy
```sql
-- Always use transactions for migrations
BEGIN;
  -- Migration code here
  INSERT INTO migration_log (version, description, applied_at) 
  VALUES ('001', 'Enhanced schema migration', NOW());
COMMIT;
```

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage for services and business logic
- **Widget Tests**: All custom widgets and screens
- **Integration Tests**: Critical user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for 50+ concurrent users

### Security Checklist
- [ ] All user inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] RLS policies implemented for all tables
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted
- [ ] API endpoints protected
- [ ] Role-based access controls enforced

### Performance Targets
- [ ] App startup time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Screen transitions < 300ms
- [ ] Offline sync completion < 30 seconds
- [ ] Search results < 1 second
- [ ] Report generation < 10 seconds

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Data Migration Failure**
   - Mitigation: Complete database backup before migration
   - Rollback plan: Database restore procedures

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Mitigation: Gradual rollout with monitoring
   - Monitoring: Performance metrics dashboard

3. **User Adoption Issues**
   - Mitigation: Phased rollout with training
   - Support: Comprehensive user documentation

### Business Continuity
- Maintain existing system during migration
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- 24/7 monitoring during critical phases
- Immediate rollback capabilities
